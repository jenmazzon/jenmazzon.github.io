      <h2>Join the Social Impact Quest</h2>
      <p>Tech has finally hit the social impact sector with a bang and there are open tech jobs in social impact organizations.
          Non-profits, government agencies, B-corps and those rare mission-driven for profits are all looking to solve problems that matter at scale.
          Philanthropic foundations, billionaires and governments are investing in innovative social impact organizations.
          Social entrepreneurs are joining fellowships, incubators and competitions to get their social impact ventures funded. 
          <span class="colored-sentence">YOU CAN DO IT. You can be a social entrepreneur or get a tech job in social impact.</span> </p>

        <h2>Advance Your Career in Tech</h2>
        <p>You love building tech products. You want to hone your craft, deepen your skills, and make a difference.
          To accomplish this, you thought that you'd have to work at a VC-backed, for profit company like FAANG or some sweathouse startup.
          But you know that if you do this, you will wither and burn out because that job will not feed your hunger for impact. 
          You have an intrinsic need to solve problems that truly matter, that will help nudge the world towards a better future.
         <span class="colored-sentence">YOU CAN DO BOTH. You can have a successful tech career AND have positive social impact.</span> </p>

      <h2>Learn More About Product4Good</h2>
      <p>My name is <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jenmazzon">Jen Mazzon</a> and after 30 years working in for-profit Silicon Valley tech, I now lead a tech team at a U.S. national nonprofit.
          I have written a book about how I pivoted my career to social impact, how working in social impact is different from working in traditional for profit companies, 
          and how product development works differently (or not so much) in a social impact organization vs. a traditional for profit company.
          I want to encourage others to pursue their dreams BOTH building tech AND making social impact.<span class="colored-sentence">
